# OBJECTIVE
The objective of this project is to design, configure, and secure a Domain Name System (DNS) server within a virtual network environment to provide reliable and secure name resolution services. This hands-on experience was designed to deepen understanding of DNS queries and defensive strategies to secure the requests being made to the server.

# SKILLS LEARNED
-Installing and configuring DNS services in a Windows environment.\
-Creating forward and reverse lookup zones.\
-Managing A, AAAA, CNAME, MX, PTR, and TXT records.\
-Testing DNS lookup using Wireshark and nslookup.\
-Configuring Domain Name System Security Extensions (DNSSEC).\
-Implementing DNS logging and monitoring.\

# TOOLS USED
-VirtualBox\
-Windows Server Manager\
-Windows DNS Manager\
-Wireshark\

# Network Setup & Topology:
For this lab, we will create a small virtual network within a tool called VirtualBox where we will host our DNS server and user endpoints. After building each machine using their ISO images, we are able to create our network within the ‘Tools’ tab of the application. In our case, we have created a virtual network called ‘Specter Network’ with an assigned IP range of 192.168.0.0/24 (Figure 1.1).
